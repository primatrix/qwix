"""Integration of QEP (Quantization Error Propagation) into Qwix.

QEP extends GPTQ by accounting for quantization noise in input activations seen
by later layers.

The algorithm operates stagewise through the layers of a model: for each stage,
it collects paired float vs progressively quantized inputs across the full
calibration set, quantizes that stage, updates the quantized model state, and
then continues to the next stage.

This implementation currently supports Flax linen models only.

  QEP extends GPTQ by accounting for quantization noise in input activations

  assuming perfect (float) inputs, QEP measures the actual accumulated
  quantization error from preceding layers and shifts the current layer's
  weights to compensate for that noise.

  This rule tells the quantization pipeline to treat matched weights as part
  of a QEP stage. It configures the hyperparameters for the QEP correction
  step, which computes a weight delta using the difference between float
  and quantized input activations.

    correction_factor: Weight correction factor. 0.0 = no correction (equivalent

  """Executes Quantization Error Propagation (QEP) on a flax linen model.

  QEP extends iterative PTQ/GPTQ by observing the actual numerical divergence
  between the float and quantized model states. It sweeps through the
  calibration dataset continuously, adjusting the parameters of each localized
  "stage" by accounting both for the layer's internal structural Hessian and the
  shifted activations stemming from all preceding, previously quantized layers.

  The quantization proceeds as follows:
  1. Discover supported matched ops in forward order on one float pass.
  2. Infer stages by grouping consecutive matched ops that share the same input
     activation object.
  3. For each stage, replay the calibration set twice per batch:
     one float forward and one forward using dequantized weights from already
     quantized earlier stages.
  4. Accumulate `_qep` stats locally targeting the stage.
  5. Apply the QEP formula compensating against errors, and discrete the format
  with GPTQ.
  6. PTQ-quantize any remaining rule-matched weights.

  Args:
    model: The targeted `flax.linen.Module` architecture describing the float
      network.
    calibration_data: A reiterable collection representing the calibration
      dataset, or a zero-argument callable serving fresh iterators over the full
      dataset.
    rules: Sequence of definitions mapping layers to their quantization rules.
    variables: Frozen variables collection natively encompassing the mutating
      `params` array branch.
    batch_adapter: Utility restricting array parameters across arguments
      formatting sequentially.
    methods: Exposes subset routines of the internal models bounded
      sub-functions.
    abstract_quantized: Cached metadata representation bounding discrete
      structures.
    allow_extra_params: Permits external structural fields evading discrete
      arrays constraints.
    gptq_block_size: Resolution block constraints managing boundaries correctly
      mapping natively.
    gptq_damping_factor: Numeric scale lowering evaluation Hessian variances
      across numeric types.

  Returns:
    A structured tuple holding the target model, the resulting discretized array
    formats, and the
    statistics metadata variables bounding exact error structures statically.
