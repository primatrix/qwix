"""QEP (Quantization Error Propagation) core algorithms.

This contains the pure-function QEP primitives for computing QEP statistics
and applying weight correction. QEP extends GPTQ by accounting for
quantization noise in input activations from previous layers.

  """Computes QEP (Quantization Error Propagation) statistics.

  QEP extends GPTQ by accounting for quantization noise in input activations.
  Instead of minimizing ||W @ X - W_q @ X||^2 (standard GPTQ), QEP minimizes
  ||W @ X - W_q @ X_q||^2 where X_q are quantized inputs from previous layers.

  This requires two statistics:
    - hessian: X_q @ X_q^T (Hessian from quantized inputs)
    - hessian_delta: (X_float - X_q) @ X_q^T (cross-correlation of input error)

  Args:
    X_q: Quantized input activations, shape (in_features, n_samples).
    X_float: Float input activations, shape (in_features, n_samples).

  Returns:
    A dict with 'hessian' and 'hessian_delta', both (in_features, in_features).
